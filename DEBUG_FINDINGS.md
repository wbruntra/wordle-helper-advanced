# Debug Findings - Wordle Answers Database Issue

## Summary
**FULLY RESOLVED** ✓ The database was empty because:
1. **Database connection issue**: `parseAnswers.ts` was using `sqlite3` driver instead of `knex-bun-sqlite` 
2. **Hidden answer parsing bug**: Today's answer (#1595) wasn't being captured because the hidden span CSS selector didn't match `display:none;` format

All issues have been fixed and the database now contains **1595 answers** including today's Wordle (#1595 = ABHOR on 2025-10-31).

---

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue #1: Inconsistent Database Driver
**Problem**: 
- `db_connect.js` uses `knex-bun-sqlite` client
- `parseAnswers.ts` was creating its own knex instance with `sqlite3` client
- This likely caused database connection issues or separate database instances

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Changed from:
const db = knex({
  client: "sqlite3",
  connection: { filename: path.join(process.cwd(), "wordle.sqlite3") },
  useNullAsDefault: true,
})

// To:
import db from "./db_connect.js";
// Now uses the shared database connection with knex-bun-sqlite
```

### Issue #2: Hidden Answer Not Being Captured
**Problem**:
- Today's Wordle answer is hidden on the website with a "Reveal" button
- The CSS selector was looking for `span[style*='display: none']` with space
- But the actual HTML used `display:none;` (no space)
- Result: Today's answer (#1595 = ABHOR) was never extracted

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Now checks both formats:
let hiddenSpan = $(cells[2]).find("span[style*='display:none']");  // no space
if (hiddenSpan.length === 0) {
  hiddenSpan = $(cells[2]).find("span[style*='display: none']");   // with space
}
```

### Issue #3: Script Missing Verification
**Problem**:
- The `update-wordle-answers.sh` script reported success but couldn't verify data was actually inserted
- Made it impossible to detect when the database wasn't being populated

**Fix Applied**:
- Added database verification step that:
  - Queries the database after insertion
  - Reports total row count and most recent entry
  - Exits with error if verification fails

## Database Status

### Before Fixes
- Total rows: 0
- Most recent entry: None
- Script logs: "SUCCESS" (false positives)

### After Fixes
```
✓ Total entries in database: 1595
✓ Most recent entry: 2025-10-31 = ABHOR
✓ Second most recent: 2025-10-30 = LATHE
✓ All entries from past to present are captured
```

## Files Modified

1. **parseAnswers.ts**
   - Changed to use shared `db_connect.js` instead of creating own knex instance
   - Fixed hidden span CSS selector to handle both `display:none;` and `display: none`

2. **update-wordle-answers.sh**
   - Added verification step after parsing
   - Now queries database and reports actual row count
   - Exits with error if database doesn't have expected data

---

## How to Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Run the full update script
cd /home/william/wordle-helper-advanced
bash update-wordle-answers.sh

# Check database directly
bun -e "
  const db = require('./db_connect.js');
  const count = await db('answer_history').count('* as count').first();
  const recent = await db('answer_history').select('date', 'word').orderBy('date', 'desc').first();
  console.log('Total rows:', count.count);
  console.log('Most recent:', recent.date, '=', recent.word);
  await db.destroy();
"
```
